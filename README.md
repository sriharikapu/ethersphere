## Running the app

#### Terminal #1:
```
docker-compose up -d
make serve
```

#### Terminal #2:
```
make webpack
```

> Why `make` instead of `npm`?

These commands indeed do run npm commmands, but it runs it inside the docker
container. This saves you the extra work of having to type out the docker
commands every time.

## Workers
Once the app starts up, some workers will also start running that import
required data such as token prices. These run on an interval, and need to
have run at least once in order for the app to run properly. If you see
errors when you first launch the app, and the app has been running less than
5 minutes, try waiting a bit and refresh then see if it goes away.

## Explore the API

Once the app is running you can view/query the graphql API explorer at: http://localhost:3000/graphiql

## Debugging

Chrome canary now ships with a node debugger button as shown below:

![debugger](https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/1i0C2O2n1G2F370V2r2N/%5Ba59661ea9da99b4d5a5739016404bb34%5D_Screenshot%25202017-05-23%252005.05.21.png?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=1754851&v=e920ded3)

Click on that, and make sure you have localhost:9229 as a source. A console for
the app should show up when it starts.

## Helpers
```
# Create a production build
npm run build   

# Log into the container shell
make shell

# Run node console inside docker
make console

# Access mongo client inside docker
make mongo-client
```

Run tests
```
make test
```

## Notes

* In client code, `import '~/foo'` refers to `src/client/foo`. In server code,
  the same code refers to `src/server/foo`. In other words, '~' is an alias for
  the respective code's "home" directory.

* We follow the [airbnb style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) (with some changes) for javascript and the [airbnb react style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react) for React.
